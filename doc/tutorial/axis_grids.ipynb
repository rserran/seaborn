    "When exploring medium-dimensional data, a useful approach is to draw multiple instances of the same plot on different subsets of your dataset. This technique is sometimes called either \"lattice\" or \"trellis\" plotting, and it is related to the idea of `\"small multiples\" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_multiple>`_. It allows a viewer to quickly extract a large amount of information about complex data. Matplotlib offers good support for making figures with multiple axes; seaborn builds on top of this to directly link the structure of the plot to the structure of your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use these features, your data has to be in a Pandas DataFrame and it must take the form of what Hadley Whickam calls `\"tidy\" data <https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf>`_. In brief, that means your dataframe should be structured such that each column is a variable and each row is an observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For advanced use, you can use the objects discussed in this part of the tutorial directly, which will provide maximum flexibility. Some seaborn functions (such as :func:`lmplot`, :func:`catplot`, and :func:`pairplot`) also use them behind the scenes. Unlike other seaborn functions that are \"Axes-level\" and draw onto specific (possibly already-existing) matplotlib ``Axes`` without otherwise manipulating the figure, these higher-level functions create a figure when called and are generally more strict about how it gets set up. In some cases, arguments either to those functions or to the constructor of the class they rely on will provide a different interface attributes like the figure size, as in the case of :func:`lmplot` where you can set the height and aspect ratio for each facet rather than the overall size of the figure. Any function that uses one of these objects will always return it after plotting, though, and most of these objects have convenience methods for changing how the plot is drawn, often in a more abstract and easy way."
